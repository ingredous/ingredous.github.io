# Introduction

In the summer of 2023, I had the opportunity to deliver a talk at BSides Prishtina, focusing on the development of bots for Java Games, specifically centered around Runescape Private Servers.

## Extension

As mentioned in the final slide of the talk, the topic of obfuscation was not covered during the presentation. However, to address this important aspect, I have prepared a follow-up blog post that delves into the practical demonstration of approaching an obfuscated client.
