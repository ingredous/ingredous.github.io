# Introduction

Online Invoicing System suffers from a SQL Injection found in `/membership_passwordReset.php` which is the endpoint that is responsible for self password resets. An unauthenticated attacker is able to input a specially crafted payload which can result in sensitive information being extracted from the database eventually leading into an application takeover. This vulnerability is introduced as a result of the developer trying to roll their own sanitization implementation in order to allow the application to be used in legacy environments.

# Exploitation Details

**PHP Version used throughout this writeup: PHP 7.4.8**

Exploring the source found in: `app/membership_passwordReset.php`:

On Line 5, `$username` is initialized with the value returned from passing the user-input into the `makeSafe()` function. The user-input is passed in through the `username` parameter found in the body of the following POST request:

username=test&email=&reset=Ok
~~~

After `$username` is intialized, the application eventually constructs and executes a SQL query which contains the user-input as shown on Line 21 which would be the sink in this case:

~~~php
$where = '';
		if($username){
			$where = "lcase(memberID)='{$username}'";
		}elseif($email){
			$where = "email='{$email}'";
		}
$res = sql("select * from membership_users where {$where} limit 1", $eo);
~~~

However as `$username` is first passed into the `makeSafe()` function before being concantenated into the query, it appears to be sanitized.

Let's explore the `makeSafe()` function found in `app/admin/incFunctions.php` to learn more:

![Screenshot]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/posts/2020/ois-sql/2.png)

From a high level overview, it can be inferred that this function is indeed responsible for sanitizing user-input by escaping any potentially dangerous characters. However to understand how this function works in greater detail, lets break it down line by line.

On Line 2, the application performs a ternary operation in order to re-initalize the value of `$string` (which is the value of the user-input passed into this function).

~~~php
if($is_gpc) $string = (get_magic_quotes_gpc() ? stripslashes($string) : $string);
~~~

As shown by the function definition, `$is_gpc` is set to `True` by default meaning the above line will always be executed. The ternary operation is then performed based on the result returned from the `get_magic_quotes_gpc()` function. 

Some quick context regarding the `get_magic_quotes_gpc()` function from the PHP Docs:

> Returns 0 if magic_quotes_gpc is off, 1 otherwise. Or always returns false as of PHP 5.4.0.

The last line here is key. As of "newer" PHP Versions, this will always result in false meaning that the ternary operation will never call the `stripslashes()` function on the user-input but re-initalize it the way it is. This isn't deterimental as there is additional logic performed in the `makeSafe()` function.

After `$string` is re-initalized, the function continues. On Line 6, the application initalizes `$na` which is an array composed of potentially dangerous characters that can result in an injection such as null-bytes, carriage returns, line feeds, etc. These are the same characters in which PHP's `mysqli_real_escape_string()` function escapes. Finally two booleans `$escaped` and `$nosc` are initialized with the value being `true`:

~~~php
// prevent double escaping
		$na = explode(',', "\x00,\n,\r,',\",\x1a");
		$escaped = true;
        $nosc = true; // no special chars exist
~~~

Moving forward, the application then enters a for loop which iterates over the bad characters stored in the `$na` array. This loop is interesting in how it works because it initializes two new variables:

`$dan`
`$esdan`

~~~php
foreach($na as $ns){
			$dan = substr_count($string, $ns);
			$esdan = substr_count($string, "\\{$ns}");
			if($dan != $esdan) $escaped = false;
			if($dan) $nosc = false;
        }
~~~

The application takes the value of the user-input which is stored in `$string`, the bad character in the current iteration and calls the `substr_count()` function against both which returns the number of occurences of the bad character found in `$string`. This value is then stored in `$dan`:

~~~php
$dan = substr_count($string, $ns);
~~~

The application then nearly performs the same thing however this time it passes an escaped variant of the bad character to see if any matches are found in the string. The returned value is then stored in `$esdan`:

~~~php
$esdan = substr_count($string, "\\{$ns}");
~~~

Finally the application then performs a comparison to see if the value of `$dan` and `$esdan` are different. If these values are different, this means that a character from the blacklist was found un-escaped in the user-input and if so `$escaped` is set to `false`.

~~~php
if($dan != $esdan) $escaped = false;
~~~


Lastly the application checks if `$dan` is true meaning if there was one or more occurence of a blacklist character found in the user input. If so, `$nosc` is set to false and the function moves on:

~~~php
if($dan) $nosc = false;
~~~

At this point, we have reached the final logic in the application which is only triggered if `$nosc` results in `true`. The only way this can occur is if there are no blacklisted characters in the user input. 

~~~php
if($nosc){
			// find unescaped \
			$dan = substr_count($string, '\\');
			$esdan = substr_count($string, '\\\\');
			if($dan != $esdan * 2) $escaped = false;
        }
~~~

To quickly break down this function's logic, it compares the number of escaped backslashes and unescaped backslashes found in the user-input. The logic here is that if the number of escaped backslashes (meaning a backslash followed immediately by another backslash) is not double the amount of backslashes found in the user-input, there is an un-escaped backslash (which can result in injection in some cases) and `$escaped` is set to false. What may seem confusing at first is you would think that in order to reach this function, `$escaped` would've already been set to false earlier, however keep in mind that you can reach this function if your user-input does not contain any blacklisted characters.

Finally we reach the return statement of the function, which is another ternary operation:

~~~php
return ($escaped ? $string : db_escape($string));
~~~

This ternary condition takes the value of `$escaped` and if `true`, returns the value of `$string` directly. However if `$escaped` results in false, the user-input is then passed into the `db_escape()` function which is essentially a wrapper function over `mysql?_escape_string` (essentially depending on your version of PHP):

![Screenshot]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/posts/2020/ois-sql/3.png)

Taking a step back, we can see that this logic seems to be fairly sound. However there is one small flaw here that can result in a fatal vulnerability.

Before we start exploring this, let's do a quick recap of the `makeSafe()` function logic:

~~~
1. Count the number of blacklist character occurences in the string and store the value in $dan
2. Count the number of escaped blacklist character occurences in the string and store in $esdan
3. Compare $dan & $esdan; if different then set $escaped to false
4. If there is at least one blacklist character meaing that $dan is more than 0, set $nosc = false
5. If $nosc is true (meaning there are no blacklisted characters), count the number of escaped vs unescaped backslashes and compare.
6. If escaped backslashes is not double the value of unescaped backslashes, set $escaped to false.
7. If $escaped is true, return string directly. Else pass to db_escape() function which sanitizes string using the mysqli_escape_string function
~~~

**In order for a successful attack, it is imperative that the value of `$escaped` is `true` at the end as it would mean that the string would be returned directly instead of being passed into the `db_escape()` function therefore rendering the injection useless as the user input would be correctly sanitized.**

With this in mind, we can try using the following payload which if passed into a query will be able to break out:
~~~
test\\'
~~~

To recap the payload above, we notice:

~~~
- Valid SQLi payload (as we would be able to append arbitrary queries we would like to inject after the ')
- Contains a blacklisted character (') 
- Contains an even amount of backslashes + in front of the blacklisted character therefore 'escaping' it
~~~

After adding a few debug statements which will print what the `makeSafe()` function is doing behind the scenes (to make it easier to understand visually), we can pass this value to the application and see what happens:

![Screenshot]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/posts/2020/ois-sql/4.png)

As shown in the debug statements, when the iteration loop reaches the `'` special character found in the payload, the following values are returned:

~~~
Value of special character: '
membership_passwordReset.php:145 Value of dan: 1
membership_passwordReset.php:145 Value of esdan: 1
membership_passwordReset.php:145 Value of escaped: true
membership_passwordReset.php:145 Value of nosc: false
~~~

As there is one special character, `$dan` is set to 1. As we are escaping the special character (as there is a backslash prepended to it), the value of `$esdan` is 1 as well. As `$dan == $esdan`, the value of `$escaped` remains unchanged at `true` which is crucial. However since `$dan` is greater than 0 (since the user input contains a black list character), `$nosc` is set to false meaning that the function skips the second conditional check (where it compares the amount of escaped backslashes vs unescaped).

Since the function skips the second conditional, the return statement is reached with the value of `$escaped` being set to `true` meaning that the user-input is directly returned as is aka unsanitized and dangerous.

Coming back to the logic which is in charge of concatenating the finalized query:

~~~php
$where = '';
		if($username){
			$where = "lcase(memberID)='{$username}'";
		}elseif($email){
			$where = "email='{$email}'";
		}
$res = sql("select * from membership_users where {$where} limit 1", $eo);
~~~

In this case the value of `$username` is set to `test\\'` meaning the full query will look something similar to:

~~~
select * from membership_users where lcase(memberID)='test\\'' limit 1
~~~

To confirm this is the case, we can enable logging in `mysql` and fire off a request which will result in this query being executed:
