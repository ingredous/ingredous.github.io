# Introduction

Online Invoicing System suffers from a SQL Injection found in `/membership_passwordReset.php` which is the endpoint that is responsible for self password resets. An unauthenticated attacker is able to input a specially crafted payload which can result in sensitive information being extracted from the database eventually leading into an application takeover. This vulnerability is introduced as a result of the developer trying to roll their own sanitization implementation in order to allow the application to be used in legacy environments.

# Exploitation Details

**PHP Version used throughout this writeup: PHP 7.4.8**
